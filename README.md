# The Terminal Philosopher

No more passive boring terminals!
Today we make a stand!

Dr. Terminal Philosopher is here to make you wonder about the questions that don't matter!

## What's that all about?

With The Philosophical Terminal, every time you open your gnome terminal you get a random
philosophical question, to which you can type in an answer.

Your answer is stored in a local file for later research, along with a timestamp and
the number of the question you answered.

After you answer, the terminal screen refreshes and you get a randomly picked answer from your history.

(In case you are in a hurry, you can just press 'Enter' to continue...)

## Installation

To install:
1) In the *Terminal Philosopher* folder do `chmod +x install.sh` to make the installation script executable. 
2) Run `./install.sh`

That's all! Now open your terminal and good luck!

You can add more (or remove) questions in the questions file, as long as it is typed in one line.

Have fun!
